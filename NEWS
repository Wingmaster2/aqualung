          --disable-nls           do not use Native Language Support
          --disable-rpath         do not hardcode runtime library paths
          in addition to other options to aide in finding libiconv and
          libintl.
        * Cygwin builds now support configure --without-winmm should
          somebody want, for example, a JACK-only Aqualung build.
        * Debug builds now work on BSD platforms with libexecinfo.
        * configure --without-loop is now configure --disable-loop
        * configure --without-podcast is now configure --disable-podcast
        * configure --without-systray is now configure --disable-systray
        * configure's --with-ogg option was renamed to --with-vorbis
        * JACK enabled builds may optionally be pruned of the port management
          UI with configure --disable-jack-mgmt
        * Transcoding (via the Export and Rip CD UIs), can now be left
          out of the build even with sndfile or flac decoding capability left
          in by using the --disable-transcoding option.
    - Runtime
        * The disk IO thread is no longer high-priority by default on
          Win32 builds, pass the -D / --disk-realtime option to re-enable
          priority scheduling if you need it.
