README for Aqualung skins
=========================


This archive contains a skin for the Aqualung music player program.

To install it, untar the archive in the ~/.aqualung directory if you
want to install it for one user, or in the $prefix/share/aqualung/skin
directory if you want to make it system-wide. ($prefix is the prefix
you used when installing Aqualung itself; it is likely to be /usr or
/usr/local.)

Skins are considered to be non-necessary components of Aqualung
itself, and they are freely redistributable under the same conditions
as the main program. This means: GNU GPL.

Visit the Aqualung homepage [http://aqualung.sf.net] for more info.
