Aqualung README
===============


Aqualung is an advanced music player primarily targeted for the
GNU/Linux operating system, but also usable on FreeBSD and Cygwin.

Homepage: http://aqualung.sf.net

Please see the homepage for a general introduction to the program,
including compilation instructions.

Please refer to the documentation provided with the program for a
detailed description of features, usage tips and miscellaneous info.
You will find it in the doc/ directory in .pdf and .lyx formats.

Please consider subscribing to the project's mailing list at:
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/aqualung-friends

General questions about compiling, usage etc. should go to this list
rather than the developer's private address. This is also the place
for development discussions.

The primary place for bugreports is the project's web-based
bugtracker at: http://aqualung.sf.net/mantis


Enjoy,
