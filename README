Please see the homepage for a general introduction to the program,
including compilation instructions.

Please refer to the documentation provided on the homepage for a
detailed description of features, usage tips and miscellaneous info.

Please consider subscribing to the project's mailing list at:

General questions about compiling, usage etc. should go to this list
rather than the developer's private address. This is also the place
for development discussions.
