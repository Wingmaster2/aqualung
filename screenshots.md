Aqualung is a music player primarily designed to sound good. However,
the appearance of the program is not a particular disgrace
either. Multiple skins are supported, and you may as well roll your
own if you don't like the existing ones. Here you will see a few
full-sized desktop screenshots showing the available skins, so as to
give you a sample of the program's look & feel. Click on the pictures
to view them in full size.
