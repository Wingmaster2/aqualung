LADSPA plugins</h2>

<p>One great feature of the program is that you can apply
LADSPA plugins to the music. You can use the equalizer of your
choice instead of a built-in one, along with other
plugins. You can process your sound with Aqualung in ways that
the author of this program never thought of. A recommended set
is <a class="external" href="http://tap-plugins.sourceforge.net">TAP-plugins</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, faithful reproduction of music does not require
or permit pervasive signal processing, since that is not the
purpose of such activity. However, the technology is at your
disposal and it's up to you to use or misuse it. It may be
necessary to adapt your listening gear to the acoustic
environment, using small amounts of equalization preferably in
a subtractive manner. In addition to this, I also like to
spice my tracks with a small amount of tubewarmth to feel that
warm tube sound even with my transistor amplifiers, and to
bring out even the finest details of the music.</p>

<p>The plugin chain you build is automatically saved and
restored, so once you get it right for your listening
environment, you should rarely need to touch it.</p>

<p>Some tricks concerning the LADSPA patch builder:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Multiple plugins can be selected from the available
plugins list and added at once by clicking on the <span class="gui">Add
button</span> or pressing `a' or `A'.
</li>
<li>
A single plugin can be added immediately by
double-clicking it in the available plugins list.
</li>
<li>
Plugins in the running list can be (un)bypassed with the
middle mouse button.
</li>
<li>
The configuration window of the running plugins can be
brought up by double-clicking on them (same as clicking on
the <span class="gui">Configure</span> button).
</li>
<li>
If a plugin is selected in the running plugins list,
pressing DELETE will remove it (same as pressing the
<span class="gui">Remove</span> button).
</li>
<li>
Running plugins can be rearranged at any time (changing
the order in which they are processed) via dragging them
with the mouse.
</li>
<li>
In the configuration windows of plugins, setting input
controls back to their default value is possible by
shift-clicking on the slider. This does not work for
toggled or integer inputs (those that don't have a slider
displayed for them).
</li>
</ul>
