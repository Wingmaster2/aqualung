Playlist</h2>

<p>The Playlist normally receives its contents from the Music
Store. However, you can put any file in the Playlist
regardless of the contents of your Music Store, using the
<span class="gui">Add files</span> button at the bottom of the
window. Adding a directory or a URL are also supported, by
right-clicking on the button and selecting the appropriate
menu item, <span class="gui">Add directory</span> or <span class="gui">Add URL</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="gui">Add URL</span> menu item can be used to listen to
Internet radio stations streaming Ogg Vorbis or MP3. You will
be shown a dialog with an entry, in which you should enter the
URL of the stream. Pressing <span class="gui">OK</span> will add it to the
Playlist. After you start playing the stream, the Playlist
entry changes to the name of the radio station, with the
description provided by the station in brackets.</p>

<p>The other two buttons (<span class="gui">Select all</span>, <span class="gui">Remove
selected</span>) function as you would expect them when clicked
with the left mouse button. Clicking with the right mouse
button brings up popup menus that contain further options as
seen with the <span class="gui">Add files</span> button.</p>

<p>There is a statusbar under the list showing the total time
of the Playlist and the duration of the selected tracks, as
well as the size of the songs (if enabled).</p>

<p>The Playlist can not only maintain a linear list of songs,
but is also capable of keeping the tracks of albums
together. This is done when a Store, Artist or Record has been
added to the Playlist using the so-called Album mode,
available from the popup menu in Music Store. If you tend to
use it extensively, there is an option on the
<span class="gui">Settings / Playlist</span> page to make it default, so drag
&amp; drop and adding via keyboard shortcut will use this mode
automatically.</p>

<p>Aqualung supports playlist tabs, which allow you to have
multiple playlists for your music at the same time, very
similarly to multiple tabbed browsing in Firefox. Creating new
tabs is possible via CTRL+T in the Playlist window,
double-clicking on the tab bar, or using the right-click
context menu of the tab labels. This context menu can also be
used to rename tabs, close other tabs, or undo
closing. Another trick is that middle clicking on an item in
the Music Store adds the content to a new playlist tab, which
will be named after the middle-clicked element by default.
Closing a tab has several ways: clicking the close button
located on each tab, middle-clicking on a tab, using the tab
context menu, or by pressing CTRL+W in the Playlist
window. Undo close tab is possible until you quit
Aqualung. Tabs can be reordered via drag &amp; drop.</p>

<p>The contents of the Playlist can be saved and restored
automatically when the program exits and starts up, and/or
periodically with adjustable interval. (Whether this should be
done is a configuration option, covered later.) In addition
to this, you can save the Playlist manually at any time, or
load a previously saved playlist file. To do this, right-click
in the Playlist area, which will bring up a popup menu with
these features.</p>

<p>The Playlist is saved as an XML file, unless you specify a
filename ending in <tt>.m3u</tt>, in which case it is
saved in M3U format (one filename per line). When saving an
XML playlist, you should
normally end your filename with <tt>.xml</tt> &ndash;
however, this is only good practice and not necessary. If you
choose <span class="gui">Save all playlists</span>, the XML will be a
multi-tabbed playlist, containing all tabs, while <span class="gui">Save
playlist</span> saves the current playlist only. When saving
all playlists, it will always use the XML format, as the M3U
file format does not support multiple playlists. Note that the
XML playlist file format is not compatible with Winamp/XMMS
<tt>.m3u</tt> files. However, Aqualung will open playlists
in M3U and PLS formats whenever possible.</p>

<p>When opening a multi-tabbed playlist, all opened tabs will
be appended after the present ones, and the existing tabs will
be remained intact, regardless of whether you chose loading
(which normally clears the current playlist before adding) or
enqueueing (which appends songs to the playlist). Opening any
other playlist type (single XML playlist created by <span class="gui">Save
playlist</span>, M3U or PLS playlists) will behave according to
the option you chose (`Load in new tab', `Load' or
`Enqueue').</p>

<p>The usual cut, copy and paste functions are accessible via
keyboard shortcuts, and work across playlist tabs as
well. Rearranging tracks by drag &amp; dropping items is also
supported. You can even drag a track from a playlist into
another, by dragging on the tab first in order to switch to
the target playlist. The only restriction is that album nodes
cannot be pasted or dropped inside another album node.</p>
