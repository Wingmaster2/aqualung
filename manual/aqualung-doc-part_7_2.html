Playlist</h2>

<p>The Playlist is embedded in the Main window by default to
achieve a more compact look. Turn it off to put the Playlist
into a separate window.</p>

<p>You can set whether to use Album mode by default when
adding songs from Music Store to the Playlist. Regardless of
this setting, you can always add tracks without using Album
mode by using the <span class="gui">Add to playlist</span> popup menu in
Music Store.</p>

<p>Settings concerning playlist tabs can be made too. You can
control whether to have close buttons on playlist tabs. If
you don't want the tab bar to be hidden when only one tab is
open, uncheck the <span class="gui">Always show the tab bar</span> item.</p>

<p>The option to save/restore the Playlist when exiting and
starting the program is turned on by default. If you prefer
starting with an empty Playlist every time, turn it off. You
can also set whether to save the Playlist periodically. The
interval for this is adjustable between 1 and 60 minutes.</p>

<p>Here you can also set the visibility of the track lengths
and RVA values in the Playlist. By drag &amp; dropping entries
in the list, you can rearrange the columns. The position of
those that are not shown is of course irrelevant. Other
options should be obvious, such as hiding the statusbar, or
showing active track name in bold.</p>
