Starting the program for the first time</h2>

<p>Aqualung has a large number of configuration settings,
which are adjustable through the user interface at run-time
(no need to edit config files by hand), and are remembered
across multiple invocations of the program. When Aqualung
starts for the first time, it creates a configuration based on
some wired-in defaults. A good way of exploring the program's
capabilities is poking through the configuration area. You can
access this by clicking in the main window with the right
mouse button, which will pop up the program's main
menu. Choosing <span class="gui">Settings</span> from the menu will open the
configuration dialog.</p>

<p>In fact, clicking with the right mouse button almost
anywhere is a generally smart idea. Aqualung has lots of
context-sensitive popup menus in the Music Store, the Playlist
(often embedded in the main window) and elsewhere. It's good
to keep this in mind when taking the explorative approach
instead of reading the whole manual right away.</p>

<p>Let's add some music to the Playlist and start playback
right away. Right-click the <span class="gui">Add files</span> button, and
choose <span class="gui">Add directory</span> from the menu. (The
right-clicking trick works for the other two buttons as
well. Left-clicking is a shortcut to immediately execute the
action denoted by the button's caption.) Choose a directory
with some music under it. It's OK to have subdirectories under
this directory, the program will search for playable files
recursively. After the Playlist starts to get populated with
tracks, press play, or double-click on one of the tracks to
play. Press `i' to see metadata information about the
selected track.</p>
