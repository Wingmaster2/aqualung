CD Audio</h2>

<p>You can set the drive speed for CD playing in CD-ROM speed
units. Lower speed usually means less drive noise. However,
when using Paranoia error correction modes for increased
accuracy, generally much larger speeds are required to prevent
buffer underruns (and thus audible drop-outs), but this is
very device-specific.</p>

<p>Most drives let Aqualung know when a CD has been inserted
or removed. However, some drives don't report correctly, and
thus it may happen that a newly inserted CD remains unnoticed
to Aqualung. In such cases, forcing TOC re-read on every drive
scan should help.</p>

<p>Aqualung can automatically add newly inserted CDs to the
Playlist, and remove them when the CD is removed from the
drive. A CD will only be added if the Playlist doesn't already
contain any of its tracks. The newly added CD will appear at
the top of the Playlist, but after all CD tracks or albums
being in the list.</p>

<p>Removal from Playlist will happen if the CD is removed from
the drive, or the user quits Aqualung while the CD is in the
drive. All tracks of the CD will be removed, even if they were
mixed with other audio files or some of them were removed
manually.</p>
