DSP</h2>

<p>Changing the two options on the <span class="gui">DSP</span> page takes
effect immediately, and stays that way regardless of whether
you leave the dialog with the <span class="gui">OK</span> or
<span class="gui">Cancel</span> button.</p>

<p>The sample rate converter type should be chosen to fit the
resources of your computer, and provide the best affordable
quality at the same time. So fire up top or something similar
on a spare terminal, and start with the best converter. If
your machine is not very new, this will consume huge amounts
of CPU, and the playback will very likely be choppy. If this
is the case, you will have to pick another
converter. <span class="gui">Fastest Sinc Interpolator</span> is usable on
today's most machines. If not, use <span class="gui">Linear
Interpolator</span> instead of <span class="gui">ZOH</span> since both are
blindingly fast, but linear is naturally much better than
zero-order (constant hold). It should also be noted that the
CPU usage of sample rate conversion is greatly affected by the
difference between the two sample rates: upsampling 32k to 96k
will be much more expensive than, say, upsampling from 44.1k
to 48k.</p>

<p>Of course, sample rate conversion springs into action only
when the output sample rate (the sample rate you specified in
case of OSS or ALSA, or the sample rate the JACK server
specified in case of JACK) does not match the sample rate of
the track you are playing. A typical situation is when you
have 44.1k files grabbed from CD and play back at 48k.</p>
