JACK Port Setup</h2>

<p>If you use JACK output, you need this dialog to route the
outputs of the program somewhere (most likely to the playback
ports representing the soundcard driver). If you want the
outputs to be connected automatically to the first two
hardware playback devices, use the <code>-a</code> (or
<code>--auto</code>) command line option.</p>

<p>On the left, each output port has a list of its current
connections. By clicking on any list item, that connection
will be removed. The <span class="gui">Clear connections</span> button
removes all connections from the output ports.</p>

<p>The notebook on the right has a page for all client
programs and hardware devices available to the JACK
server. Naturally only those are shown which are data sinks
(hardware playback devices or inputs of JACK clients), thus
connectable to outputs which are data sources. By selecting a
notebook page, you will see a list of that client's input
ports. Clicking on a list item connects the port to the
currently selected Aqualung output port (which has a blue
header). You can change the selected output port by clicking
on the unselected (grey) list header. When you add connections
to the output ports, the selection alters between the two
outputs so connecting both outputs is very fast and easy.</p>

<p>If you start up another JACK client while the dialog is
open, you may press the <span class="gui">Rescan</span> button to make it
appear in the notebook. Closing and re-opening the dialog has
the same effect, since JACK ports are re-read and a new dialog
instance is built every time.</p>
