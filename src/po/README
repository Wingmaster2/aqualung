Creating new translation
------------------------

If you are willing to create a new translation, first obtain the
current message catalog by typing

$ make aqualung.pot

This will generate the file aqulaung.pot, which contains all strings
subject to translation. You should rename this file to XX.po where XX
is the two-letter ISO-639 code for your language.

First fill in the header entry by replacing the uppercase words with
sensible information. The important thing is to set charset=UTF-8 in
the Content-Type field, and the whole file must be encoded in UTF-8.

Next step is translation itself. You are suggested using a decent
editor with .po syntax support to make the process easier. When
finished with translating, send the file to the aqualung-friends
mailing list. We will include it in the distribution.

To test your translation, first insert it into the list in Makefile.am
(line 13, starting with "POFILES = ") under this directory (src/po).
Then run `make' and `make install' , after which your installed
Aqualung should contain your translation.


Updating your translation
-------------------------

As Aqualung development progresses, some text changes and new strings
appear. Translations therefore need to be updated from time to time.

You can merge the changes to your language file by typing

$ make XX.po

Now you can edit the .po file and translate new strings, fix fuzzy
entries and remove obsolete ones. Finally, send the updated version of
your .po file to the mailing list.
