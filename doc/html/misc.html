<h2>Project policies</h2>

<p>
Notices about smaller or greater development advancements, CVS
commits, etc. will go to our catch-all <a
href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/aqualung-friends">mailing
list</a> called <code>aqualung-friends</code>. This list should serve
as the primary forum of development discussion, as well as user
support. If you have a question regarding the compilation or usage of
Aqualung, please join the list and ask there. We will discuss new
features and design decisions there as well, and you are hereby
invited to take part in this process. Finally, if you have patches,
they should be sent to the list as well. If not accepted immediately,
your contribution will be discussed in an open way.
</p>

<p>
Bugs should be reported primarily to our <a
href="http://aqualung.sf.net/mantis/">bugtracker</a>. Feel free to add
your feature requests there as well (use the appropriate
category). You can also report bugs directly to the mailing list, but
the preferred way is to use the bugtracker. If you are not sure if you
found a real bug, feel free to write to the list prior to filing a
bugreport. But it's OK to report a non-bug into the bugtracker, so
don't be too shy.
</p>

<p>
Announcements of major advancements of Aqualung development will be
CC:-ed to the <a href="http://www.linuxaudiodev.org">Linux Audio
Developers</a>, the Linux Audio Users and the Linux Audio Announce
mailing lists.

<p>
New translations for any language are happily accepted at any
time. Just roll the <code>.po</code> file for your language based on
the master <code>src/po/aqualung.pot</code> file, and send it to the
mailing list. We'll include it in the distribution.
</p>

<p>
As Aqualung development progresses, some text changes and new strings
appear. Translations therefore need to be updated from time to time.
If you are a translator, send an updated version of your
<code>.po</code> file to the mailing list at any time you feel fit.

<h2>Thank you all!</h2>

<p>
Thanks to everyone who contributed to Aqualung's development, be it
patches, comments, suggestions, bugreports, feature requests, etc. You
may not even realize that your letter asking for help with
compilation/usage/etc. gave us ideas to make Aqualung "Software That
Sucks Less(TM)". Thanks to everyone who downloaded and tried the
program.
</p>

<p>
