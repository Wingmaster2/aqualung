<h2>Download Aqualung</h2>

<p>
Aqualung is primarily released as a source code tarball
archive. Download the latest one from the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/aqualung">SourceForge project
page</a>.
</p>

<p>
The latest release tarball version is <code>0.9beta4.1</code>. You can
read the <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> to decide whether you want
to upgrade from a previous version.
</p>

<p>
Most development happens in CVS, so if you want to take part in the
development process, or try the very latest version, you have to get
the code from CVS. This is possible by means of the anonymous CVS access
provided by SourceForge.net. To obtain a copy of the Aqualung source
repository, follow these steps (<code>%</code> is meant to be your
prompt):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>% cd /usr/local/src</code><br>
(just an example, it can be anywhere)
</p>

<p>
<code>% cvs
-d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.aqualung.sf.net:/cvsroot/aqualung
login</code><br>
(just press enter when prompted for a password)
</p>

<p>
<code>% cvs
-d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.aqualung.sf.net:/cvsroot/aqualung -z3
co aqualung</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is also an online <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/aqualung">web-based CVS
browser</a>. Nice to see if there is anything new.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally we might post a link to a CVS tarball here; particularly
when someone has problems accessing SF.net anonymous CVS due to server
problems. (If you tried the above instructions repeatedly, but they
seem to hang, go ahead and ask for a CVS tarball on our <a
href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/aqualung-friends">mailing
list</a>. We'll put it right here.)

<h2>Get additional skins</h2>

<p>
Skins greatly alter the appearance of the program (just check out our
<a href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a>). You can change the skin
currently in use at any time, simply by selecting it from the
program's corresponding setup dialog. (Hint: right-click almost
anywhere in the main window.) The program will then re-skin itself
immediately, and stay that way. No configuration file editing is
needed, nor is it necessary to restart the program.
</p>

<p>
The Aqualung source contains the four basic skins (dark, default,
metal, woody) supported by the developers. Supported means that these
skins will be kept up to date with regard to the latest developments
(new dialogs, new, formerly unused widgets etc.) These four skins are
part of the Aqualung source distribution, and are automatically
installed as part of the <code>make install</code> process.
</p>

<p>
The following table shows additional skins. These are distributed as
<code>.tar.gz</code> archives. After downloading any of these, all you
need to do is unpack it either in your <code>~/.aqualung</code>
directory, or the system-wide Aqualung skin directory (which is
<code>${prefix}/share/aqualung/skin</code> where
<code>${prefix}</code> is the prefix you used when installing Aqualung
itself; it is likely to be <code>/usr</code> or
<code>/usr/local</code>).
</p>

<p>
The program may be running when you install the new skin (that is, you
need not close the program before you unpack a skin). The new skin
will be immediately available after you reopen the skin chooser
dialog.
</p>

<p>
The skins in the following table are authored by indepent
contributors.  We accept no responsibility and offer no support
concerning their use.  As Aqualung development proceeds, skins
generally (but not always) need to be updated to keep up with newer
GUI components. We are happy to receive updated versions of these
skins from their authors at any time, and will update the downloadable
version.
</p>

<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="5" border="1">
<tr><th>skin name</th><th>current as of Aqualung version</th><th>download link</th><th>description</th><th>author</th></tr>

<tr><td>plain</td><td>0.9beta3</td><td><a
href="http://aqualung.sf.net/skins/aqualung-plain.tar.gz">http://aqualung.sf.net/skins/aqualung-plain.tar.gz</a>
</td><td>A simple skin using the default GTK 2.4.x color scheme and
GTK 2.5.x stock icons.</td><td>pasp</td></tr>

</table>

<p>
Creating new skins is easy if you are familiar with the usual GTK+
stuff concerning rc files, pixmaps etc. Look at the existing skins to
find out about their internals. You are encouraged to create new skins
of your style, and send them to us. Your contribution will be welcome,
and most probably added to the above table.
</p>

<p>
Skins are considered to be non-necessary components of Aqualung
itself, and they are freely redistributable under the same conditions
as the main program. See the <a href="misc.html">Misc</a> page for
details.
