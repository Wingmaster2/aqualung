<i>Aqualung</i> </font><font size="4" color="#0044aa">is a music
player for the GNU/Linux operating system. It plays audio files from
your filesystem and has the feature of </font><font size="5"
color="#0044aa"><i>inserting no gaps</i> </font><font size="4"
color="#0044aa"> between adjacent tracks.</font></p>

<p>
<b>Here's how the test looks like.</b> Pick a song that you know
really well, something that's in your bones like <i>Siberian
Khatru</i>. Grab it from CD using <code>cdparanoia</code> to have it
as a WAV file. Now open your favourite wave editor and slice the file
up into multiple consecutive sections. Be careful not to insert
silence, delete samples or alter any sample data. Save the slices to
separate files. Now convert the sample rate of some pieces to random
values (the example program shipped with the <a
href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/">libsamplerate</a> library will
let you do this in very good quality). Pick some pieces and convert
them to <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis">Ogg Vorbis</a>
format. Pick some others and encode them to <a
href="http://flac.sourceforge.net">FLAC</a>. Pick a few and convert
them to mono. Now open up the playlist editor of the music player in
question and add the files in order. <b>Push play, and listen</b>.
</p>

<p>
You are probably nodding your head, but today's popular music player
software: Winamp (on that other OS), XMMS, FreeAmp, Zinf and
AlsaPlayer <b>all fail this test</b>. These programs are completely
unusable to the serious listener because they fail to provide one
humble feature: <i>the ability to play back a list of consecutive
audio files without terrible gaps in between tracks</i>.  (Although
XMMS does have a plugin called <a
href="http://www.eisenlohr.org/xmms-crossfade/">xmms-crossfade</a>
which mitigates this problem.)
</p>

<p>
That's right. But fortunately enough, Aqualung is here to fix all the
mess. It is a music player designed from the ground up to provide
continuous, absolutely transparent, gap-free playback across a variety
of input formats and a wide range of sample rates thereby allowing for
enjoying quality music: concert recordings and "non-best-of" albums
containing gapless transitions between some tracks. (Multiple
movements long compositions are often broken into separate but
gaplessly flowing tracks when mastered to CD). Obvious examples are
<i>The Song Remains The Same</i> (Led Zeppelin), <i>The Dark Side Of
The Moon</i> (Pink Floyd), and
<i>Yessongs</i> (Yes). Besides the ability to play the music from
these records without a defect, Aqualung provides high quality sample
rate conversion, a feature that is essential when building large
digital music archives containing input sources conforming to various
standards. <b>Aqualung passed our test -- and it will pass yours,
too.</b>
</p>


<br>
<h2>Features at a glance</h2>


<i>On the input side:</i>
<ul>

<li>Almost all sample-based, uncompressed formats (eg. WAV, AIFF, AU
etc.) are supported. For the full list of these formats, visit the <a
href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/">libsndfile</a>
homepage.</li>

<li>Files encoded with <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net">FLAC</a>
(the Free Lossless Audio Codec) are supported.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis">Ogg Vorbis</a> audio
files are supported.</li>

<li>MPEG Audio files are supported. This includes MPEG 1-2-2.5, Layer
I-II-III encoded audio, including the infamous MPEG-1 Layer III format
also known as MP3. libMAD (which Aqualung uses) provides noticeably
higher quality output than mpg123 (which XMMS relies upon).</li>

<li>MOD audio files (MOD, S3M, XM, IT, etc.) are supported via the
libmodplug library. This provides higher quality than MikMod (used by
XMMS as the default MOD decoder) and <i>much</i> higher quality than
Winamp.</li>

<li>Naturally, any of these files can be mono or stereo.</li>

</ul>


<i>On the output side:</i>
<ul>

<li>OSS driver support</li>

<li>ALSA driver support</li>

<li><a href="http://jackit.sourceforge.net">JACK</a> Audio Server support</li>

</ul>


<i>In between:</i>
<ul>

<li>Continuous, gap-free playback of consecutive tracks. Your ears get
exactly what is in the files -- no silence inserted in between.</li>

<li>Ability to convert sample rates between the input file and the
output device, from downsampling by a factor of 12 to upsampling by
the same factor. The best converter provides a signal-to-noise ratio
of 97dB with -3dB passband extending from DC to 96% of the theoretical
best bandwidth for a given pair of input and output sample rates.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.ladspa.org">LADSPA</a> plugin support -- you
can use any suitable LADSPA plugin to enhance the music you are
listening to. There are many different equalizer, spatial enhancer,
tube preamp simulator etc. plugins out there. If you don't have any,
<a href="http://tap-plugins.sf.net">grab these</a>.</li>

</ul>


<i>Other niceties:</i>

<ul>

<li>Internally working volume and balance controls (not touching the
soundcard mixer).</li>

<li>Support for multiple skins; changing them is possible at any time.</li>

<li>Support for random seeking during playback.</li>

<li>Track repeat, List repeat and Shuffle mode (besides normal playback)</li>

<li>Ability to display FLAC stream metadata, Ogg Vorbis comments and
ID3v2 tags found in MP3 and other files.</li>

<li>All windows are sizable. You can stretch the main window
horizontally for more accurate seeking.</li>

<li>You can control any running instance of the program remotely from
the command line (start, stop, pause etc.). Remote loading or
enqueueing soundfiles as well as complete playlists is also
supported.</li>

<li>State persistence via XML config files. Aqualung will come up in
the same state as it was when you closed it, including playback modes,
volume & balance settings, currently processing LADSPA plugins, window
sizes, positions & visibility, and other miscellaneous options.</li>

</ul>


<p>
In addition to all this, Aqualung comes with a <i>Music Store</i> that
is an XML-based music database, capable of storing various metadata
about music on your computer (including, but not limited to, the names
of artists, and the titles of records and tracks). You can (and
should) organize your music into a tree of Artists/Records/Tracks,
thereby making life easier than with the all-in-one Winamp/XMMS
playlist. Importing file metadata (ID3v2 tags, Ogg Vorbis comments,
FLAC metadata) into the Music Store is supported.
</p>

<p>
Although Aqualung is officially still in beta stage, it is fairly
stable for everyday use. Reports of utter failure (segmentation
faults, crashes and the like) are extremely rare. In particular, we
have a record of <b>zero bugs that caused data loss or corruption</b>
since the first public release of the program. If you are looking for
a player that <i>works</i>, Aqualung may be just what you need.
