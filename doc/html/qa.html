<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

<p>
Please read these before reporting a bug, complaining about missing
features or misfeatures, sending patches etc. Some of the points below
are here to state the developer's concepts about what this software is
and what it is not. Some other issues are also covered.
</p>


<br>
<p><i>Can I play CD's, or listen to streaming media (HTTP,
*cast)?</i></p>
<p>
Not with this program. Aqualung is designed solely to play audio files
within the reach of your local computer filesystem. Note: you can have
a computer that stores your music and listen to it from all other
machines on the same LAN by mounting it via NFS. (I have actually
verified that such setup works flawlessly.) If you have CD's, you
should grab them onboard and encode them with FLAC (that's what I do)
or Ogg Vorbis (if you don't mind the lossy compression).  Then add the
music to your Music Store, and you should never need to touch that CD
again. It will serve well as an archive copy. If you really want to
directly play a CD, you need (guess what) a CD player program.
</p>

<p>
Please note that while Aqualung already provides a lot of features in
its present form, it is still under development. These features are
considered useful, and will likely be implemented sometime. They just
need more investigation (and the developer's time is limited).
</p>


<br>
<p><i>Do I really have to type in all the track titles by hand?
Haven't you heard about freedb.org?</i></p>
<p>
I have, but it's not as trivial as it may seem. (Let me not go into
details about it now. Before you ask, it has very little to do with my
personal skills; I can handle UNIX network programming.) For now,
there is no freedb or other such support in the program. I am strongly
considering this functionality to be added, and it is likely to happen
sometime. Don't hold back your breath, though. If you want to help, I
am open to discussions and happy to receive patches.
</p>



<br>
<p><i>The program uses large amounts of CPU. Why?</i></p>
<p>
If you use Sample Rate Conversion on a not too fast machine, problems
may arise when choosing a high quality converter. (That means choppy
playback, as the computer can't do the processing in real time.) High
quality resampling with bandlimited sinc interpolation is just very
CPU intensive. If you have a slower machine, try running the "Fastest
Sinc Interpolator". Not as CPU-hungry as the higher quality ones, but
still not too bad to listen to.  Also, if you have many LADSPA plugins
running, you may run out of CPU power. There is really no need to run
so much plugins. As a side note, some LADSPA plugins (those that have
feedback loops in themselves, such as echoes and recursive filters)
may have so-called denormal floating point bugs that cause exponential
increasing of the CPU usage until all of it is used up. It usually
occurs when the signal level gets very low at song endings and such
places. If this happens to you, try to track it down to a single
plugin, and contact the author of that plugin.
</p>


<br>
<p><i>I did hear very short dropouts when changing tracks! You
lied!</i></p>
<p>
I did indeed. But you were listening to MP3's, weren't you? If not,
send me a bug report. If yes, read on. MP3 (MPEG 1 Layer III audio
compression) is an old format now completely obsoleted by better ones
(notably Ogg Vorbis). One of the shortcomings of MP3 (and MPEG Audio
in general) is that you cannot encode audio streams of arbitrary
lengths. To encode, the stream has to be padded so its length will be
an integer multiple of the MPEG frame length (so as to encode it into
an integer number of frames). So encoders pad the ends of tracks, and
when they are played back, the silence is also decoded since there is
no way to tell where in the last frame audio stops and padding
begins. The MPEG decoder library returns the decoded stream with the
silence at the end; the silence is not inserted by Aqualung. This is a
shortcoming of MPEG Audio, and you won't experience it with Ogg Vorbis
or FLAC.
</p>


<br>
<p><i>Seeking in MP3 files is a bit fuzzy. Sometimes when I release
the seek slider, it jumps to another position and plays from
there.</i></p>
<p>
Another MP3 issue. MPEG Audio has no built-in support for seeking; a
decoder would have to read through the whole stream before actually
playing anything and build a seeking table internally that contains
the legal positions where seeking is possible. At present, Aqualung
just seeks the bitstream and hopes that the MPEG decoder will be able
to recover not too far from the desired position. This mostly works
for properly encoded files, but may fail badly on others. Please
understand that I included MP3 support solely to deal with legacy
issues; you should never encode newly ripped music into MP3 (use Ogg
Vorbis instead). Therefore I'm not willing to spend much time on
improving the MPEG playback interface; after all, you can playback the
files without seeking (and seeking also works on most files, most of
the time). However, if you have a patch, I will be happy to accept it.
</p>


<br>
<p><i>The program was playing a track when I cleared the playlist. The
playlist got empty, but the program is still playing. What the
heck?</i></p>
<p>
This is consciously chosen behaviour. The other possibility would be
to stop playback every time the currently playing track is removed
from the playlist. Instead of that, playback proceeds (which is
natural, since once playback started, the engine can proceed with it
regardless of the contents of the playlist). Playback will stop only
when the track ends and playback would move to the next track. This
gives you the possibility to change playlists without ever needing to
stop playback.
</p>


<br>
<p><i>Where is the spectrum analyzer? Where are the visualization
plugins?</i></p>
<p>
Dude, if you feel like gaining information about the spectral content
of the music that's playing, you simply got to <i>listen</i> to it.
No 20-bar "spectrum analyzer" will give you information of that
density and accuracy. The human ear is one of the most sensitive
instruments ever made, outperforming any ordinary measurement
technology. Besides that, the author believes that music is for
listening, not for viewing. If you want idiotic flashing lights that
have no real connection to the sound but perhaps look nice to some
people (that being the only acceptable excuse for their existance), go
find some other program. Note that I will not accept patches that
would add such (mis)features to the program.
