\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aqualung is a music player originally designed for the GNU/Linux operating
 system, but also running on FreeBSD and NT-based versions of Microsoft
 Windows.
 It plays audio CDs, as well as audio files from your filesystem and has
 the feature of inserting no gaps between adjacent tracks.
 It also supports high quality sample rate conversion between the file and
 the output device, when necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Audio CDs can be played back and ripped with on-the-fly conversion to WAV,
 FLAC, Ogg Vorbis or CBR/VBR MP3 (gapless via LAME).
 Seamless tagging of the created files is offered as part of the process.
 Almost all sample-based, uncompressed formats (e.g.\InsetSpace ~
WAV, AIFF, AU etc.) are
 supported.
 Files encoded with FLAC (the Free Lossless Audio Codec), Ogg Vorbis, Ogg
 Speex, MPEG Audio (including the infamous MP3 format), MOD audio formats
 (MOD, S3M, XM, IT, etc.), Musepack and Monkey's Audio Codec are also supported.
 Numerous formats and codecs are supported via the FFmpeg project, including
 AC3, AAC, WMA, WavPack and the soundtrack of many video formats.
 The program can play the music through OSS, ALSA or the JACK Audio Connection
 Kit, or even using the Win32 Sound API (available only under Cygwin or
 native Win32).
 Depending on the compile-time options, not all file formats and output
 drivers may be usable.
 Type `
\family typewriter
aqualung -v
\family default
' to get a list of all the compiled-in features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aqualung supports the LADSPA 1.1 plugin standard.
 You can use any suitable plugin to enhance the music you are listening
 to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other features of the program are: internally working volume and balance
 controls (not touching the soundcard mixer), multiple skin support, random
 seeking during playback, track repeat, list repeat and shuffle mode (besides
 normal playback).
 In track repeat mode the looping range is adjustable.
 Aqualung will come up in the same state as it was when you closed it, including
 playback modes, volume and balance settings, currently processing LADSPA
 plugins, window sizes, positions and visibility, and other miscellaneous
 options.
 Aqualung has the ability to display and edit Ogg Xiph comments, ID3v1,
 ID3v2 and APE tags found in files that support them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently metadata editing capability is considered dangerous and is turned
 off by default, because the TagLib library which Aqualung uses for metadata
 access has some yet unfixed, serious bugs which may cause invalid tags
 to be written or may result in outright corrupt (unplayable) files.
 If you decide to build Aqualung with metadata editing support, make sure
 to have backups of your files and proceed with care.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can control any running instance of the program remotely from the command
 line (start, stop, pause etc.).
 Remote loading or enqueueing soundfiles as well as complete playlists is
 also supported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to all this, Aqualung provides a so-called Music Store that
 is an XML-based music database, capable of storing various metadata about
 music on your computer (including, but not limited to, the names of artists,
 and the titles of records and tracks).
 You can (and should) organize your music into trees of Artists/Records/Tracks,
 thereby making life easier than with the all-in-one Winamp/XMMS playlist.
 Importing file metadata (ID3v1, ID3v2 tags, Ogg Xiph comments, APE metadata)
 into the Music Store as well as getting track names from a CDDB/FreeDB
 database is supported.
 For audio CDs, CD-Text retrieval is also implemented.
\end_layout

Quick Start Guide
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you'd like to get your hands on the program quickly rather than to spend
 your evening reading the rest of the manual, here is the absolute minimum
 you need to know to successfully use the program.
 So make sure to read this (deliberately short) chapter, and come back for
 the rest when you have questions while using the program.
 Ultimately, you may ask questions on the Aqualung-friends mailing list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Getting Aqualung
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not hard to get Aqualung up and running on your machine, although
 for beginners the number of options might be intimidating at first.
 The steps you need to take depend on the platform and operating system
 you use.
 For detailed information please look at the relevant page of the Aqualung
 website: 
\family typewriter
http://aqualung.sourceforge.net/index.php?tab=compiling
\family default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case you are not used to compiling software yourself, you may check whether
 there is a distribution-provided package of Aqualung.
 Installing such a package is generally the easiest and fastest way to get
 Aqualung, however this way you won't be able to try the latest features.
 Currently there are Aqualung packages for major Linux distributions such
 as Debian, Gentoo, SuSE, etc.
 If your distribution lacks such a package, consider contacting the organization
 maintaining the distribution and ask them to provide a package of Aqualung.
 Anyway, you might have to compile Aqualung from source.
 This is not very hard, either -- the 
\family typewriter
configure
\family default
 script tries to adapt Aqualung to your system as much as possible without
 breaking the program.
 See the above website for more information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Microsoft Windows, all you have to do is download and run the self-extracting
 installer utility, which guides you through a few easy to follow steps
 and installs the program on your machine.
 Make sure to visit 
\family typewriter
http://aqualung.sf.net/win32
\family default
 for more information about the Windows version of Aqualung.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Starting the program for the first time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aqualung has a large number of configuration settings, which are adjustable
 through the user interface at run-time (no need to edit config files by
 hand), and are remembered across multiple invocations of the program.
 When Aqualung starts for the first time, it creates a configuration based
 on some wired-in defaults.
 A good way of exploring the program's capabilities is poking through the
 configuration area.
 You can access this by clicking in the main window with the right mouse
 button, which will pop up the program's main menu.
 Choosing Settings from the menu will open the configuration dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact, clicking with the right mouse button almost anywhere is a generally
 smart idea.
 Aqualung has lots of context-sensitive popup menus in the Music Store,
 the Playlist (often embedded in the main window) and elsewhere.
 It's good to keep this in mind when taking the explorative approach instead
 of reading the whole manual right away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's add some music to the playlist and start playback right away.
 Right-click the 
\family sans
Add\InsetSpace ~
files
\family default
 button, and choose 
\family sans
Add\InsetSpace ~
directory
\family default
 from the menu.
 (The right-clicking trick works for the other two buttons as well.
 Left-clicking is a shortcut to immediately execute the action denoted by
 the button's caption.) Choose a directory with some music under it.
 It's OK to have subdirectories under this directory, the program will search
 for playable files recursively.
 After the playlist starts to get populated with tracks, press play, or
 double-click on one of the tracks to play.
 Press 'i' to see metadata information about the selected track.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Setting up a Music Store
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that you have some music playing, let's get more organised.
 In the Music Store window click in the empty area with the right mouse
 button and choose 
\family sans
Create\InsetSpace ~
empty\InsetSpace ~
store...

\family default
 from the menu.
 Enter a meaningful name such as 
\family sans
Tom's Music
\family default
 and choose a location to save the XML file of the store to.
 This should be a writable location, so it is wise to stick to a location
 inside your home directory.
 (A system-wide path or a remote NFS mount with read-only access won't do.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can have any number of such stores in the Music Store organizer, and
 it is indeed a great idea to have separate stores for music differentiated
 by origin, genre, or some other aspect.
 One great use is multiple stores with the actual music files stored on
 multiple remote machines, one store for each machine.
 Or just a store for your local music and another for files on your bedroom
 file server box.
 There are several possibilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But how do you populate the store with music you already have on your drive?
 It's easy if your music is stored in an organized manner on the filesystem
 level.
 As a minimum, this means that tracks intended to go into one store are
 found under a common root directory in the filesystem (there may be several
 directory layers down from the root to the individual files, but there
 must be a common ancestor).
 In this case the so-called Music Store Builder will take care of things
 for you.
 Right-click on your newly-created empty store and choose 
\family sans
Build\InsetSpace ~
/\InsetSpace ~
Update\InsetSpace ~
store\InsetSpace ~
from\InsetSpace ~
filesystem
\family default
.
 Choose 
\family sans
Independent
\family default
 mode and in the dialog you get, enter the root directory under which your
 collection resides.
 As you can probably guess at this point, the store builder interface is
 pretty flexible, however the default settings should be good to get something
 together quickly without further hassle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pressing OK will start the process, during which the directory structure
 below the root you specified will be traversed.
 The artist/record/track names are determined from potentially multiple
 data sources (CDDB, metadata e.g.
 ID3v2 tags or Ogg Xiph comments, and filesystem names).
 The logic involved is fairly elaborate.
 You are strongly advised to read the detailed usage instructions for the
 Music Store Builder at Section\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Building-or-Updating}

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Playing and ripping an Audio CD
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can play CDs with Aqualung easily.
 Just put the CD in one of your CD drives, and if everything goes well,
 Aqualung will detect it, do a CDDB lookup to retrieve artist, record and
 track info (CD-Text is also used if the CD has it), and make it available
 to you through the special Music Store node called 
\family sans
CD\InsetSpace ~
Audio
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You don't have to be happy with what you have so far.
 The Music Store paradigm is fairly addictive, as it's much easier to drop
 something into the playlist from the Music Store than physically placing
 a CD in the drive.
 So as you keep expanding your CD collection, you will probably want to
 have those records in one of your music stores, too.
 In this case all you have to do is choose 
\family sans
Rip\InsetSpace ~
CD...

\family default
 from the disc's popup menu, and supply some information.
 We won't go into details here (please refer to Section\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Audio-CD}

\end_inset

 in case the interface is not obvious).
 However, it is worth stating that you should have a separate directory
 for the files of each record.
 Ripping multiple CDs into the same directory won't work.

 In addition to Aqualung's native (XML) playlist format, the program will
 load M3U and PLS playlists whenever possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you used the --session option (see above), the files will be sent to
 the Aqualung instance you specified.
 Otherwise a new instance will start up with the files you specified.
 Note that if you enabled the `Save and restore the playlist on exit/startup'
 option in the program setup dialog, the files you specify will be loaded

\begin_layout Standard
You can control most of the program from this window.
 The cue controls in the bottom-left corner are fairly obvious.
 You can drag the large slider in the middle for seeking.
 There are two smaller sliders above that, the left one is for adjusting
 the volume and the right one for adjusting the balance.
 Above these, there are two horizontal text areas showing information about
 the currently playing track, and input/output parameters such as sample
 rate, mono/stereo, bitrate, output driver (e.g.\InsetSpace ~
OSS, ALSA, JACK) etc.
 The first trick to learn is that these lines are horizontally draggable
 with the mouse if the text does not fit in the available visible space.
 However, they don't scroll automatically, and for a very good reason.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the upper left corner, you find one bigger and two smaller displays that
 show track times: elapsed time, remaining time and total track time.
 The big display also shows the current volume and balance setting when
 appropriate.
 By clicking in these displays with the left or right mouse button, you
 can rearrange the displays as you want them.
 The following table may seem a bit confusing at first, but once you realize
 the point, it becomes blindingly obvious.

Note that depending on the skin, these buttons may come with images instead
 of the letters above.
 However, their functionality does not change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remaining three buttons are to select the playback mode.
 When none of these buttons is depressed, playback goes the normal way.
 The buttons are mutually exclusive, and select track repeat, list repeat
 or shuffle mode.
 I'm sure you can figure out which is which.
 If you select track repeat, a loop bar appears above the seek bar, with
 two markers.
 The markers can be dragged to select the looping range.
 When they are at the left and right end positions, the whole song is repeated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Volume and balance slider tricks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Shift + any mouse button sets the volume and balance sliders back to 0 dB
 and Center position, respectively.
 This combination also works for the loop bar, in which case the looping
 range is set to the whole song.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Clicking and holding the right mouse button on these sliders shows their
 position in the big time display without altering the value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An additional thing to know about the volume control is that it ranges up
 to +6 dB.
 This means you can send a bigger signal to the audio device than in the
 original file.
 With 0 dB corresponding to 100% signal level, +6 dB is almost exactly 200%
 signal level (and 4 times signal power as well).
 This means you can overdrive your output device, and since clipping will
 occur at 100% anyway, it will cause nasty digital distortion much worse
 than simple analog overdrive.
 If you have a track with a reasonably low level, you can go above 0 dB
 with the volume control.
 But today most CDs are mastered to keep the average volume level very close
 to the 0 dB (or 100%) top, and so they will likely distort with as little
 as +1 dB additional gain.
 The moral is: if you want it loud, turn up your external amp.
 You can also consider using RVA if the volume level of your tracks tends
 to vary in a wide range -- see section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:RVA}

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a related note, another thing to watch out for is LADSPA plugins (in
 case you use them).
 It is very common that the signal level leaving a plugin is greater than
 the signal level the plugin gets on its input.
 So it is best to leave a few dB of headroom if you do that.
 A very typical case is boosting some frequency bands a few dB with an EQ
 plugin.
 You should decrease the overall volume level with as much dB as the largest
 boost (or even more), or you are risking that the signal will get chopped
 causing bad distortion.
 Alternatively, apply

 as the last one in the processing chain, but only if you know what you
 are doing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right-clicking almost anywhere in the window will bring up a menu that allows
 access to the `Settings' dialog, the `Skin Chooser', the `JACK Port Setup'
 dialog (present only when running the program with JACK output), and the
 `About' box.
 The latter may be useful to see which features have been compiled into
 the program.

 yet: the configuration of the program can be adapted so as not to require
 certain libraries when compiling, and not provide certain features accordingly.)

Music Store
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Music-Store}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Music Store is a simple database of all your music.
 The central philosophy of this program is that you have a large storage
 (ideally an entire hard drive or a separate partition) to store all your
 music files.
 This is not necessary for the program to work.
 The audio files can be scattered around your system as long as you have
 read permissions to them.
 However, it is strongly recommended that you devote a separate directory
 for all the music (for example, 
\family typewriter
/music
\family default
 would be a convenient place to store files that are owned by root, but
 readable by all users).
 Moreover, you can maintain several collections on different machines this
 way, and share them with other users via NFS, while keeping a (probably
 smaller) collection on your local hard drive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In these central directories, create subdirectories for each artist you
 have CDs from.
 The directory names do not have to contain the exact names, you can for
 example create 
\family typewriter
/music/ledzep
\family default
 for Led Zeppelin, 
\family typewriter
/music/crimson
\family default
 for King Crimson, 
\family typewriter
/music/hendrix
\family default
 for Jimi Hendrix and so on.
 In these directories, create subdirectories for each CD you have.
 Once again, the directory names for the records do not need to fully contain
 the record titles; they can be short and without spaces and special characters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Into the directories of records, you should rip the CD using the built-in
 ripper of Aqualung, tagging the files and adding the record to the Music
 Store as part of the process.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Building or Updating store from filesystem
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Building-or-Updating}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aqualung comes with a Music Store builder facility, which allows you to
 easily create a store from your existing audio files.
 This is useful if you already have a large music collection on your harddrive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Builder supports two approaches for automatically adding audio files
 to the Music Store.
 The directory driven mode requires the collection to be organized in a
 strict filesystem structure, where the directory structure itself specifies
 which files belong to a record, and which records belong to an artist.
 The structure should conform to one of the following patterns:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard


\backslash
begin{itemize}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard


\backslash
item[a)] root / record / track
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard


\backslash
item[b)] root / artist / record / track
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard


\backslash
item[c)] root / artist / artist / record / track
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard


\backslash
item[d)] root / artist / artist / artist / record / track
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard


\backslash
end{itemize}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pattern a) is useful when you do not have separate subdirectories for artist,
 only for records.
 The b) means that each artist and record has its own subdirectory.
 It corresponds to the structure introduced above along with the Music Store.
 The patterns c) and d) are for those who have too many artists to keep
 them at the same level; you may thus have a subdirectory for every artist
 starting with letter a, b, etc., or you can even dedicate two levels to
 them, perhaps as b/be/beatles, c/cr/crimson, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The independent mode does not follow any directory structure, only searches
 for audio files recursively starting from root.
 This doesn't allow the builder to perform CDDB lookups, so only metadata
 and filename transformations are available with this mode.
 If your audio files are basically organized in a directory structure that
 allows a directory driven build to be performed, but you also happen to
 have audio files on higher (record or artist) levels, run the builder in
 directory driven mode first, then use the independent mode on the same
 root directory to add the outstanding files too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The builder can gain information about your music from three sources: metadata
 (if your audio files are correctly tagged), CDDB lookups, and the filesystem
 names of the audio files and directories themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are up to building a new store, first create an empty store (right-click
 in Music Store, then choose the `Create empty store' item), then right-click
 on the new store and choose `Build / Update store from filesystem'.
 After selecting the desired building mode, the builder dialog appears with
 several options broken down into five notebook pages.
 Later, if you only want to update the content of a store, you can start
 a build process on a non-empty store as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the `General' page you have to select the root directory of your music
 collection.
 With the directory driven mode, the appropriate structure should also be
 selected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can exclude files from the build process that match a wildcard pattern
 (or more precisely, at least one element in a list of wildcard patterns).
 The list is comma-separated, e.g.\InsetSpace ~
`*.jpg,*.png,*.gif' will cause all files having
 jpg, png, or gif extension to be left out.
 Note that hidden files (whose name starts with a period) are always excluded.
 Also note that no spaces should be used around the commas, because they
 would be counted in the wildcard patterns, causing a lot of headache.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, you may include only those files that match a wildcard pattern.
 The syntax is the same as with the exclusion.
 This easily allows you to build a store containing music e.g.\InsetSpace ~
encoded with
 FLAC, and another store for Ogg, while the audio files can be placed together
 even in the same directory.
 Exclude and include patterns are case-insensitive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you choose to reset existing data, only track name, length, manual rva
 and empty comment fields will be overwritten, and the latter two are only
 if you have enabled them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The builder dialog has separate notebook pages for artists, records and
 tracks.
 The settings made on a page only concern the appropriate category (either
 artist, record or track).
 The operations and transformations are performed in the same order as they
 are placed on the page, from top to bottom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Data sources
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With each mode you can set the priority of data sources for artist names,
 record titles and tracks independently (highest comes first).
 Simply drag & drop the lines of the list to achieve the desired order.
 For example, if you have proper tags in you audio files for track names
 only, but none for artists and records, you may use metadata for tracks
 at first place, and use CDDB for artists and records instead.
 The data sources can also be disabled by clicking on the check boxes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The builder looks for usable data in the given priority, and will use the
 first suitable one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A short note on the Filesystem source.
 When using the directory driven mode with structure a), the artists and
 records will have the same filesystem name, which is the name of the record
 directory.
 Using pattern b), c) or d) will result in all artists, records and tracks
 having the name of their respective directory (or file, for tracks) as
 the filesystem name.
 With c) and d), the name of the rightmost artist directory is used.
 When using the independent mode, artists, records and tracks will have
 the same filesystem name, which is the filename of the audio file being
 imported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of the data source that won the contest for being the source
 of your artist, record or track name, you can perform several transformations
 on this string before accepting it as final.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Regular expressions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main goal of the regexp module is to perform sed-like substitutions,
 allowing you to extract the artist, record or track name from the string.
 It has the effect of a `sed\InsetSpace ~
s/regexp/replacement/g' command.
 The regexp must not match the empty string (the only exception is leaving
 the regexp entry empty, which disables the whole regexp module).
 The replacement is allowed to be empty in which case the matched parts
 are deleted.
 The replacement may also contain the special escapes 
\backslash
1 through 
\backslash
9 to refer to the corresponding matching sub-expressions in the regexp.
 See sed(1) and grep(1) for more information on sed substitution and regexp
 syntax.
 There is a sandbox where you can enter a string and see how it would be
 transformed, providing a safe environment for experiments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Predefined transformations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They provide some basic fixes, such as removing the extension or leading
 numbers, converting underscores to spaces, and trimming leading, tailing
 or multiple spaces.
 You can use them together with the regexp module as well, in which case
 only the replacement will be transformed, as expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Capitalization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, with this module you can force a capitalization pattern on the
 string.
 The force case entry is a comma-separated list of words or expressions
 that will be left in the form you entered them.
 An obvious example is the case of roman numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

hspace{5mm}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the standard modules present for artist, record and track names, there
 are some category dependent settings.
 For artists and records you can set the source of the sort name field,
 for tracks you can decide whether to import the Replaygain and Comment
 tags, if available.
 If you choose to reset existing data (on the General tab), only track name,
 length, manual rva and empty comment fields are overwritten, and the latter
 two are only if you enabled them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you are satisfied with the settings click `OK'.
 A new window showing the progress is displayed, and the store is filled
 up.
 You can abort the process if you encounter some error or weirdness, or
 just want to refine some settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Arranging your collection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each store, artist, record and track has fields you can fill in via bringing
 up the `Edit' dialog for that item.
 The `Visible name' is obviously the string that will appear in the Music
 Store tree, and in the Playlist.
 The `Name to sort by' is a string key used for sorting items on the same
 level of hierarchy (all artists, records of a given artist, and tracks
 of a given record).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For artists, you should enter the same here as the `Visible name' for ordinary
 band names (you can use copy & paste to do that).
 However, for some artists you will enter a slightly modified string: `Mayall,
 John' or just `Mayall' for John Mayall, for example.
 This is to ensure that `John Mayall' (which is the visible name) appears
 between `Mahavishnu' and `Morphine', and not somewhere near `Jethro Tull'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For records and tracks, the `Name to sort by' should be a decimal numbering
 of the items.
 If you added tracks to the records using the aforementioned `Auto-create
 tracks from these files' feature of the Record add dialog, the tracks will
 be automatically numbered for you this way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Last but not least, every item has a `Comment' field that may contain multiple
 lines of text, and is perfectly optional to use for any store, artist,
 record or track.
 When you have entered something in this field, it will be displayed in
 the lower area of the Music Store window when the corresponding item is
 selected in the tree.
 Use this to store miscellaneous data, such as birth dates of artists, release
 dates or comments like `Recorded live at Royal Albert Hall, \SpecialChar \ldots{}
' or `Digitized
 from original LP' for records, and movement subtitles for tracks that have
 them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Dealing with multiple stores
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned before, you may maintain several collections of audio files
 on several machines.
 Each collection is arranged in an artist/record/track hierarchy, and appears
 under a store item in the Music Store tree.
 The metadata describing one collection is located in one file on your filesyste
m.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the Settings/Music Store page you can specify several database files
 whose content is intended to appear in your Music Store.
 If a given file is unavailable, the corresponding store item will be missing
 from the Music Store.
 If the file is readonly, you can play the music, but you won't be allowed
 to change (add, edit, remove, etc.) the items in the store.
 Finally, if you have write permission on the file, you will be allowed
 to change the items.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The order in which the stores appear in the Music Store is the order of
 the corresponding database files in the list.
 The list can be reordered via drag & drop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Audio CD
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Audio-CD}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If Aqualung was compiled with Audio CD support, a store called `CD Audio'
 appears as the first store in Music Store.
 This special store contains a node for each drive in your machine.
 Detecting hot-swappable devices such as external USB drives is supported,
 so you don't need to restart the program after plugging in your drive.
 Aqualung will notice not only the change of discs in devices, but device
 changes themselves, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you insert a CD in a drive, the corresponding node will contain the
 audio tracks on that disc.
 The artist, record and track names are automatically set from CD-Text informati
on if found on the CD, or a CDDB lookup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The drive nodes have options available from the popup menu for adding content
 to the Playlist, manual CDDB lookup and submission just like normal album
 nodes do.
 They have some further CD specific options as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most important feature is ripping the CD.
 Choosing `Rip CD\SpecialChar \ldots{}
' from the popup menu will bring up a dialog with several
 options broken into notebook pages.
 The `Source' page is for selecting the tracks to be ripped, and specifying
 the artist, record and track names.
 If the CDDB lookup was successful, these fields are initialized appropriately.
 On the `Output' page you can select the directory where to put the audio
 files, and optionally the music store to which you would like to add the
 ripped CD.
 The destination directory must be empty; it is best to create a fresh new
 directory each time you rip a CD.
 Only music stores with write permission are offered, so you might not see
 all of them.
 The desired file/encoding format can also be selected, along with settings
 concerning quality, such as compression level or bitrate.
 The supported destination formats are WAV, FLAC, Ogg Vorbis and MP3.
 There is also an option to set whether the files should be tagged with
 metadata.
 (WAV does not have a tagging mechanism.
 Other formats are tagged according to their native tagging mechanism.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CD Ripping always happens with maximum available speed and with error correction
 modes manually set before every run on the last page titled `Paranoia'.
 Here you can basically choose between safe and slow ripping, and faster,
 but more insecure operation.
 The latter might be useful if you know by experience that your equipment
 is reliable, and the CD you are about to rip is not scratched or dirty.
 Even so, it is probably a good idea to use the available extra error protection
 unless you are really in a hurry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to display information about the inserted disc (CD-Text),
 or the drive itself (general info, reading or writing capabilities, etc.).
 The tray can also be ejected, if the driver supports this operation.
 Note that ripping and playing a CD at the same time is impossible for obvious
 reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Handling file metadata
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The program can read and write Ogg Xiph comments, ID3v1, ID3v2 and APE tags
 present in the files themselves.
 To see such metadata for a particular track, you will utilize the `File
 info' dialog accessible from the Music Store (right-click popup menus for
 Tracks, or press `i') and the Playlist (right-click popup menu for playlist
 entries, or press `i').
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you open the `File info' dialog from the Music Store, you will find
 buttons to the right of every metadata field that was read from the file
 (unless the store is readonly).
 By pressing these buttons, the associated data will be imported into the
 corresponding field of the relevant Track.
 For metadata fields that don't have a corresponding field in the Music
 Store, you can append their contents to the `Comment' field as a catch-all
 solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The so-called basic fields (that are common in all supported metadata formats)
 are editable, thus you can modify their contents and save them by pressing
 the `Save basic fields' button.
 Other format specific fields are also displayed, but modifying them is
 not supported.
 Creation and removal of the tags is also supported for the appropriate
 file formats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aqualung supports mass tagging, that is, writing data from the Music Store
 into file metadata.
 The feature can be invoked on a store, artist, record or a single track
 using the `Batch-update file metadata\SpecialChar \ldots{}
' popup menu item.
 Supported metadata fields are artist, record and track name, track number,
 track comment and year.
 The names are copied from the visible name fields of the artist, record
 and track, the track number and comment are set from the sort name and
 comment field of the track, respectively.
 The year is extracted from the sort name field of the record.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Using the RVA system
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:RVA}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
RVA stands for Relative Volume Adjustment, and refers to a system that is
 supposed to compensate for the fact that the perceived volume levels of
 tracks from different records are sometimes quite different.
 With usual players, you are left with the possibility to adjust the volume
 manually, when necessary; but not with Aqualung.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You have to do two things prior to using RVA in Aqualung.
 First, you have to calculate the volume of the tracks you want affected
 by the RVA system.
 To do this, use the `Calculate volume' option found in the right-click
 popup menus of Stores, Artists, Records and Tracks.
 When you activate this option, a small window will pop up with a progress
 bar.
 You can move this window out of your way, and proceed with using Aqualung.
 Processing will be carried out in the background, and should not affect
 your ability to play music at all.
 Calculated volume levels will be saved and restored with the rest of the
 Music Store.
 The values are shown in the `Edit track' dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you are done with this, open the `Settings' dialog (right-click almost
 anywhere in the main window), and select the `Playback RVA' notebook page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If `Enable playback RVA' is unchecked, the whole RVA system is turned off.
 No tracks receive adjustment.
 If playback RVA is enabled, you can select a listening environment that
 matches your setup.
 The idea is that the better your environment, the smaller adjustment you
 need to enjoy the music.
 If you work in a noisy workshop (and listen to Aqualung-played music) then
 it is best to minimize the volume differences between tracks so all tracks
 will be uniformly audible at a particular volume setting.
 If you can afford to listen to music in a silent room with high quality
 headphones or good near-field monitors, you should choose `Audiophile'
 which will yield no change to volumes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The diagram shows the input/output transfer function applied to the previously
 measured track loudness to obtain the needed adjustment needed for a particular
 track.
 The diagram is 24 dB large in both directions, with the (0, 0) point being
 in the upper right corner.
 The blue line shows the identity function (no change), while the red line
 shows the output volume (the actual transfer function).
 The adjustment applied at a particular track volume is the vertical distance
 between the two lines at that position.
 The transfer function is linear.
 You can use the `Reference volume' and `Steepness' controls to change its
 position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In most cases, it is desirable that tracks of the same record receive the
 same adjustment, so as to preserve the volume differences internal to the
 record.
 This can be enabled by checking `Apply averaged RVA to tracks of the same
 record'.
 When enabled, volume levels of the same record will be averaged and all
 tracks will be adjusted by an average value.
 Please note that measured volume levels are converted to RVA values when
 you add something from the Music Store to the Playlist.
 Therefore, this feature works only when you add an Artist or a Record.
 If you add a record by adding all the Tracks manually one after another,
 they will all receive independent RVA values.
 Also, changing RVA settings will not affect entries already in the Playlist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many records having one or two tracks that really stand out of
 the average volume level.
 (For example, there is one very silent track on an otherwise loud record.)
 In this case, these tracks would `pull down' the average volume.
 To get around this, you can adjust a threshold that will be used to sort
 out tracks that stand out too much and will be disregarded when computing
 the average volume.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can select whether you want to specify a threshold in linear volume
 units [dBFS] or you want to specify a percentage of the standard deviation
 of the set of individual track volumes to use as a threshold.
 The default values should work well for the vast majority of records.
 If you always want every track's volume to count in the average adjustment
 of the record, choose the linear threshold and set it to a really big value
 (say, 30 dB) so all tracks will be within this range.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You also have the possibility to always use a manually specified, fixed
 value as RVA for a particular track.
 In the `Edit track' dialog for that track, check the `Use manual RVA value'
 checkbox and set the value with the spinbutton on its right.
 If you e.g.\InsetSpace ~
import an ID3v2.4 RVA tag from an MP3 file, it will also set this
 field thereby circumventing Aqualung's own RVA calculation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
CDDB Support
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aqualung supports retrieving matches from a CDDB database, as well as submitting
 new records or updating existing ones.
 The features are available by right-clicking on a record in the Music Store
 and choosing the appropriate menu item.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CDDB query option starts a query (which can last a bit long if there
 are a lot of matches), and displays a dialog with the search results.
 It tends to work even if you have already encoded your audio files in a
 lossy format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there are multiple matches, you can select any of them using the combo
 box at the top of the dialog.
 The displayed fields are all editable, which is useful in case you find
 no fully acceptable match, but want to use one that is almost perfect.
 The track names can be edited by double-clicking on the desired track,
 or single clicking on an already selected entry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By pressing the `OK' button the track names of the currently selected lookup
 results will be propagated into the Music Store.
 The artist name and record title are not automatically set, but can be
 imported using the `Import as Artist' and `Import as Title' buttons on
 the right.
 Year can be imported as the sort key of the record.
 Other data (category, genre and extended data) can be appended to the comment
 field of the record in question using the `Add to Comments' button next
 to the appropriate text entry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CDDB submission option brings up a dialog which contains the artist,
 title, year, category, genre and extended data fields, and the tracklist.
 All fields (including track names) are editable.
 The artist, title, year and category fields are mandatory, the genre and
 extended data are optional.
 Track names should be all set as well.
 If you are about to update or correct an existing CDDB record, make sure
 that you choose the same category as the existing record has (this information
 can be retrieved via a CDDB query).
 You are also recommended to comply with the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the popup menu items and keyboard shortcuts, you can also
 add an item to the playlist by drag & dropping from the Music Store window
 into the Playlist.
 This method has a further advantage: you can place the newly added items
 in any position, not just append to the end of the list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Playlist
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This window has relatively few surprising features.
 It normally receives its contents from the Music Store.
 However, you can put any file in the playlist regardless of the contents
 of your Music Store, using the `Add files' button at the bottom of the
 window.
 Adding a directory is also supported, by right-clicking on the button and
 selecting the appropriate menu item.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other two buttons (`Select all', `Remove selected') function as you
 would expect them when clicked with the left mouse button.
 Clicking with the right mouse button brings up popup menus that contain
 further options as seen with the `Add files' button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a statusbar under the list showing the total time of the playlist
 and the duration of the selected tracks, as well as the size of the songs
 if enabled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contents of the playlist can be saved and restored automatically when
 the program exits and starts up.
 (Whether this should be done is a configuration option, covered later.)
 In addition to this, you can save the playlist manually at any time, or
 load a previously saved playlist file.
 To do this, right-click in the playlist area, which will bring up a popup
 menu with these features.
 The playlist is saved as an XML file, so you should normally end your filename
 with .xml -- however, this is only good practice and not necessary.
 Note that the playlist file format is not compatible with Winamp/XMMS .m3u
 files.
 However, Aqualung will open playlists in .m3u and .pls format whenever possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The playlist can not only maintain a linear list of songs, but also capable
 of keeping the tracks of albums together.
 This is done when a Store, Artist or Record has been added to the playlist
 using the so-called Album mode, available from the popup menu in Music
 Store.
 If you tend to use it extensively, there is an option on the Settings/Playlist
 page to make it default, so drag & drop and adding via keyboard shortcut
 will use this mode automatically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can rearrange the list at any time by drag & dropping items with the
 mouse.

\begin_layout Subsection
Settings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This dialog lets you set some options that affect the behavior of the program.
 It is split into multiple notebook pages to make arranging and accessing
 all the options easier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
General
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 'Title format' string will be used to construct a single title line
 from an Artist, a Record and a Track name when adding tracks to the Playlist.
 The Artist, Record and Track names should appear as '%a', '%r' and '%t'
 in the template, respectively.
 Such strings may be `%a: %t [%r]', `%a / %r / %t', `%a :: %r :: %t', or
 just about anything else you can think of.
 Note that once you add something from the Music Store to the playlist,
 the strings in the Playlist window will not update if you change this setting
 afterwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The so-called `implicit command line' is something you should pay attention
 to.
 It exists mainly for those who have a stable sound setup and always use
 the program with the same output device, e.g.\InsetSpace ~
they have only OSS and don't
 plan to upgrade.
 For such users it may be cumbersome to always specify the desired output
 device on the command line, along with its optional parameters if needed.
 So here you may enter something that you would otherwise enter on the command
 line every time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But beware: you cannot override or turn off every option, so for example
 if you enter `
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard

{-}{-}
\end_layout

\end_inset

help' here, the program will always display the standard message and exit
 immediately; and there is no way to override that from the command line.
 If you get into trouble, all you have to (or can) do is grab a text editor
 and hack it out of ~/.aqualung/config.xml where it is stored.
 You will find it between `<default_param>' and `</default_param>'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some global options to set here as well, which should be quite
 obvious to use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Playlist
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The option to save/restore the playlist when exiting and starting the program
 is turned on by default.
 If you prefer starting with an empty playlist every time, turn it off.
 Here you can also set the visibility of the track lengths and RVA values
 in the playlist.
 By drag & dropping entries in the list, you can rearrange the columns.
 The position of those that are not shown is of course irrelevant.
 Other options should be obvious, such as embedding the Playlist in the
 Main window, hiding the statusbar, and showing active track name in bold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Music Store
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose and usage of Music Store and database files have been covered
 in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Music-Store}

\end_inset

.
 On this page you can somewhat customize the Music Store, decide whether
 to hide the comment pane or the status bar, or to enable rules hint.
 If you choose to expand stores on startup, all toplevel tree nodes will
 automatically be expanded after starting Aqualung.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are also some options to handle the cover arts of your records.
 The feature can be turned on by placing an image file in the same directory
 where you keep the tracks of a record.
 The filenames that will at first be looked for are `cover.ext', `.cover.ext',
 `front.ext', `.front.ext', `folder.ext', `.folder.ext', where `ext' is one of
 `jpg', `jpeg', `png', `gif', `bmp', `tif', `tiff'.
 If none of them exists, the first image file having an appropriate extension
 will be used.
 If you select the record (or one of its tracks) in the Music Store, the
 image will be displayed in the comment pane and the File Info dialog, as
 well as in the Main window during the playback of a track from this album.
 Clicking the image will show a zoomed version of the cover.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At last, as already mentioned before, this page is the place to manage music
 store database files too.
 Pressing the `Refresh' button will update the accessibility (r, rw, unreachable
) flags of the specified store files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
DSP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Changing the two options on the `DSP' page takes effect immediately, and
 stays that way regardless of whether you leave the dialog with the `OK'
 or `Cancel' button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sample rate converter type should be chosen to fit the resources of
 your computer, and provide the best affordable quality at the same time.
 So fire up top or something similar on a spare terminal, and start with
 the best converter.
 If your machine is not very new, this will consume huge amounts of CPU,
 and the playback will very likely be choppy.
 If this is the case, you will have to pick another converter.
 `Fastest Sinc Interpolator' is usable on today's most machines.
 If not, use `Linear Interpolator' instead of `ZOH' since both are blindingly
 fast, but linear is naturally much better than zero-order (constant hold).
 It should also be noted that the CPU usage of sample rate conversion is
 greatly affected by the difference between the two sample rates: upsampling
 32k to 96k will be much more expensive than, say, upsampling from 44.1k
 to 48k.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, sample rate conversion springs into action only when the output
 sample rate (the sample rate you specified in case of OSS or ALSA, or the
 sample rate the JACK server specified in case of JACK) does not match the
 sample rate of the track you are playing.
 A typical situation is when you have 44.1k files grabbed from CD and play
 back at 48k.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Playback RVA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This page is for setting the RVA options.
 RVA has already been discussed above, see section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:RVA}

\end_inset

 for details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Metadata
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On this page you can decide whether you prefer using file metadata (if available
) instead of information from the Music Store.
 Settings can be made on Artist / Record / Track basis.
 Metadata can also be used when adding external files to Playlist (enabled
 by default).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
CD Audio
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can set the drive speed for CD playing in CD-ROM speed units.
 Lower speed usually means less drive noise.
 However, when using Paranoia error correction modes for increased accuracy,
 generally much larger speeds are required to prevent buffer underruns (and
 thus audible drop-outs).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most drives let Aqualung know when a CD has been inserted or removed.
 However, some drives don't report correctly, and thus it may happen that
 a newly inserted CD remains unnoticed to Aqualung.
 In such cases, forcing TOC re-read on every drive scan should help.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aqualung can automatically add newly inserted CDs to the Playlist, and remove
 them when the CD is removed from the drive.
 A CD will only be added if the Playlist doesn't already contain any of
 its tracks.
 The newly added CD will appear at the top of the Playlist, but after all
 CD tracks or albums being in the list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Removal from Playlist will happen if the CD is removed from the drive, or
 the user quits Aqualung while the CD is in the drive.
 All tracks of the CD will be removed, even if they were mixed with other
 audio files or some of them were removed manually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
CDDB
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can customize the CDDB lookup here.
 As for the query protocol, standard CDDBP (port 888) and CDDB over HTTP
 (port 80) are supported.
 The standard CDDBP port is the recommended choice unless some unavoidable
 firewall settings prevent you from using it.
 For submission always HTTP is used.

\begin_layout Standard
The default CDDB database server address is 
\begin_inset ERT

, but you may specify another server (maybe a close mirror).
 The connection timeout can also be set here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to update or submit records to the CDDB server, you will have
 to give a valid email address.
 Should your submission be rejected for some reason, you will receive a
 note about the failure to this address.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of connecting directly to the CDDB server you can use an HTTP proxy.
 This case you have to specify the proxy server address and port (the protocol
 will be HTTP).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Appearance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On this page you can decide whether to override some fonts and colors provided
 by the skins.
 You can change the font of the Music Store, Playlist, the track and timer
 labels, and set the color of the active track in Playlist.

\begin_layout Subsection
LADSPA Plugins
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One great feature of the program is that you can apply LADSPA plugins to
 the music.
 You can use the equalizer of your choice instead of a built-in one, along
 with other plugins.
 You can process your sound with Aqualung in ways that the author of this
 program never thought of.
 A recommended set is TAP-plugins, downloadable from 
\family typewriter
http://tap-plugins.sf.net
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, faithful reproduction of music does not require or permit pervasive
 signal processing, since that is not the purpose of such activity.
 However, the technology is at your disposal and it's up to you to use or
 misuse it.
 It may be necessary to adapt your listening gear to the acoustic environment,
 using small amounts of equalization preferably in a subtractive manner.
 In addition to this, I also like to spice my tracks with a small amount
 of tubewarmth to feel that warm tube sound even with my transistor amplifiers,
 and to bring out even the finest details of the music.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plugin chain you build is automatically saved and restored, so once
 you get it right for your listening environment, you should rarely need
 to touch it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some tricks concerning the LADSPA patch builder:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Multiple plugins can be selected from the available plugins list and added
 at once by clicking on the `Add button' or pressing `a' or `A'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A single plugin can be added immediately by double-clicking it in the available
 plugins list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Plugins in the running list can be (un)bypassed with the middle mouse button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Running plugins' configuration window can be brought up by double-clicking
 on them (same as clicking on the `Configure' button).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If a plugin is selected in the running plugins list, pressing delete will
 remove it (same as pressing the `Remove' button).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Running plugins can be rearranged at any time (changing the order in which
 they are processed) via dragging them with the mouse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the configuration windows of plugins, setting input controls back to
 their default value is possible by shift-clicking on the slider.
 This does not work for toggled or integer inputs (those that don't have
 a slider displayed for them).

\begin_layout Subsection
JACK Port Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you use JACK output, you need this dialog to route the outputs of the
 program somewhere (most likely to the playback ports representing the soundcard
 driver).
 If you want the outputs to be connected automatically to the first two
 hardware playback devices, use the -a (or 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard

{-}{-}
\end_layout

\end_inset

auto) command line option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the left, each output port has a list of its current connections.
 By clicking on any list item, that connection will be removed.
 The `Clear connections' button removes all connections from the output
 ports.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notebook on the right has a page for all client programs and hardware
 devices available to the JACK server.
 Naturally only those are shown which are data sinks (hardware playback
 devices or inputs of JACK clients), thus connectable to outputs which are
 data sources.
 By selecting a notebook page, you will see a list of that client's input
 ports.
 Clicking on a list item connects the port to the currently selected Aqualung
 output port (which has a blue header).
 You can change the selected output port by clicking on the unselected (grey)
 list header.
 When you add connections to the output ports, the selection alters between
 the two outputs so connecting both outputs is very fast and easy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you start up another JACK client while the dialog is open, you may press
 the `Rescan' button to make it appear in the notebook.
 Closing and re-opening the dialog has the same effect, since JACK ports
 are re-read and a new dialog instance is built every time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Skin Chooser
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This dialog lets you choose from the available skins at any time.
 All officially supported skins are shipped with Aqualung, and installed
 in the system-wide skin directory during `make install'.
 Skins placed in the local skin directory will only be locally available,
 which is useful for developing new skins or experimenting with the existing
 ones.
 If there are skins in the system-wide directory and the local directory
 having the same name, the local one takes precedence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
System Tray Support
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When compiled with Systray support, Aqualung will place its icon in the
 system tray (notification area), and lets all of its windows to be closed
 while still playing music.
 In this mode pressing the upper right X on the main window will not exit
 the program, only hide its windows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clicking on the systray icon with the left mouse button will toggle visibility
 of the program's windows.
 Clicking with the right button will bring up a popup menu allowing showing/hidi
ng the windows, basic cueing, and quitting Aqualung.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The systray icon has a tooltip displaying the same text as the main window's
 title.
 So it's easy to see what track is currently playing, and also the Aqualung
 instance ID (in case of more instances).
