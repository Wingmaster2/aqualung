.SH DESCRIPTION

Aqualung is a music player for the GNU/Linux operating system. It
plays audio files from your filesystem and has the feature of
inserting \fBno gaps\fR between adjacent tracks. It also supports high
quality sample rate conversion between the file and the output device,
when necessary.

Almost all sample-based, uncompressed formats (e.g. WAV, AIFF, AU etc.)
are supported. Files encoded with FLAC (the Free Lossless Audio
Codec), Ogg Vorbis, Ogg Speex, MPEG Audio (including the infamous MP3
format) and MOD audio formats (MOD, S3M, XM, IT, etc.), Musepack and
Monkey's Audio Codec are also supported. The program can play the
music through OSS, ALSA or the JACK Audio Connection Kit.

Aqualung supports the LADSPA 1.1 plugin standard. You can use any
suitable plugin to enhance the music you are listening to.

Other features of the program: internally working volume and balance
controls (not touching the soundcard mixer), multiple skin support,
random seeking during playback, track repeat, list repeat and shuffle
mode (besides normal playback). It will come up in the same state as
it was when you closed it, including playback modes, volume & balance
settings, currently processing LADSPA plugins, window sizes, positions
& visibility, and other miscellaneous options. Aqualung has the
ability to display FLAC stream metadata, Ogg Vorbis comments and ID3v2
tags found in MP3 and other files.

You can control any running instance of the program remotely from the
command line (start, stop, pause etc.). Remote loading or enqueueing
soundfiles as well as complete playlists is also supported.


In addition to all this, Aqualung provides a so-called Music Store
that is an XML-based music database, capable of storing various
metadata about music on your computer (including, but not limited to,
the names of artists, and the titles of records and tracks). You can
(and should) organize your music into trees of Artists/Records/Tracks,
thereby making life easier than with the all-in-one Winamp/XMMS
playlist. Importing file metadata (ID3v2 tags, Ogg Vorbis comments,
FLAC metadata) into the Music Store as well as getting track names
from a CDDB/Freedb database is supported.

Please refer to the documentation provided with the program for a
detailed description of features, usage tips and troubleshooting
issues. This manual page is only an abstract from the documentation,
and documents only the program's command line interface for quick
reference.


.SH OPTIONS

Normally, you have to tell the program which output device you want to
use. This is possible with the -o (--output) option. There are
specific optional parameters for all three output drivers. You can
also specify which sample rate converter you want to use, or request a
list of available converters. You may also control another instance of
the program remotely, or add files to the playlist.

The disk thread is a background worker thread doing file decoding and
sample rate conversion. If you experience short audio dropouts caused
by other programs (e.g. web browser loading a complex page) try to run
this thread at realtime with the -D (and optionally -Y) options.

.TP
.B General options:
.TP
\-D, \-\-disk-realtime
.br
Try to use realtime (SCHED_FIFO) scheduling for disk thread.
.TP
\-Y, \-\-disk-priority <int>
.br
When running \-D, set scheduler priority to <int> (defaults to 1).
.br
.TP
\-l, \-\-show-pl [yes|no]
.br
Change visibility of Playlist.
.TP
\-m, \-\-show-ms [yes|no]
.br
Change visibility of Music Store.

.TP
.B Options relevant to ALSA output:
.TP
\-d, \-\-device <name>
.br
Set the output device (defaults to plughw:0,0).
.TP
\-p, \-\-period <int>
.br
Set ALSA period size (defaults to 8192).
.TP
\-n, \-\-nperiods <int>
.br
Specify the number of periods in hardware buffer (defaults to 2).
.TP
\-r, \-\-rate <int>
.br
Set the output sample rate.
.TP
\-R, \-\-realtime
.br
Try to use realtime (SCHED_FIFO) scheduling for ALSA output thread.
.TP
\-P, \-\-priority <int>
.br
When running \-R, set scheduler priority to <int> (defaults to 1).

.TP
.B Options relevant to OSS output:
.TP
\-d, \-\-device <name>
.br
Set the output device (defaults to /dev/dsp).
.TP
\-r, \-\-rate <int>
.br
Set the output sample rate.

.TP
.B Options relevant to JACK output:
.TP
\-a[<port_L>,<port_R>], \-\-auto[=<port_L>,<port_R>]
.br
Auto-connect output ports to given JACK ports (defaults to first two
hardware playback ports).

.TP
\-c, \-\-client <name>
.br
Set client name (needed if you want to run multiple instances of the program).

.TP
.B Options relevant to the Sample Rate Converter:
.TP
\-s[<int>], \-\-srctype[=<int>]
.br
Choose the SRC type, or print the list of available types if no number
given. The default is SRC type 4 (Linear Interpolator).

.TP
.B Options for remote cue control:

.PP
Note that remote controlling of instances is only possible if the
instance you want to send a command to is running as the same user as
you are when you issue the remote command.

.TP
\-N, \-\-session <int>
.br
Specify the instance number to send the remote command to. Instances
are numbered on a per user basis, starting with 0. Except for the
zero-th instance (started first), the instance number is displayed in
the title bar of the main window (e.g.: Aqualung.3). If you don't use
this option, the following options will control the zero-th instance
by default, except for -L which defaults to the present instance (so
as to be able to start playback immediately from the command line).

.TP
\-B, \-\-back
.br
Jump to previous track.

.TP
\-F, \-\-fwd
.br
Jump to next track.

.TP
\-L, \-\-play
.br
Start playing.

.TP
\-U, \-\-pause
.br
Pause playback, or resume if already paused.

.TP
\-T, \-\-back
.br
Stop playback.

.TP
\-V, \-\-volume [m|M]|[=]<val>
.br
Adjust the volume. m/M means mute; if = is present, the remote
instance's volume control will be set to the value specified,
otherwise, the volume will be adjusted by the supplied (signed)
value. The values are in dB units.

.TP
\-Q, \-\-quit
.br
Terminate remote instance.


.TP
.B Options for file loading:

.PP
You may specify filenames on the command line. These may be ordinary
soundfiles playable by Aqualung, or playlist files you saved
earlier. The program will decide if a file is a playlist, and add its
contents accordingly. In addition to Aqualung's native (XML) playlist
format, the program will load M3U and PLS playlists whenever possible.

If you used the --session option (see above), the files will be sent
to the Aqualung instance you specified. Otherwise a new instance will
start up with the files you specified. Note that if you enabled the
"Save and restore the playlist on exit/startup" option in the program
setup dialog, the files you specify will be loaded \fBafter\fR the
automatically loaded ones.

.TP
\-E, \-\-enqueue
.br
Enqueue added files to the playlist instead of loading them (which
removes the previous contents of the playlist). Use this if you want
to keep the existing items in the playlist.


.TP
.B Examples:
.br
$ aqualung -s3 -o alsa -R -r 48000 -d hw:0,0 -p 2048 -n 2
.br
$ aqualung --srctype=1 --output oss --rate 96000
.br
$ aqualung -o jack -a -E `find ./ledzeppelin/ -name "*.flac"`


.PP
Depending on the compile-time options, not all file formats
and output drivers may be usable. Use the --version option to see the
list of compiled-in features.
